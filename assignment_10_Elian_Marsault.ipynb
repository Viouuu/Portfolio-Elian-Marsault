Keras offers you a backend to automatically download the dataset, similarly to what we did so far with Seaborn and Iris.\n",

    "#### BONUS **[ZERO pt]** Edit the Keras MNIST code to use a simple RNN, then cheat by passing all images of a class in a sequence (careful with batch size). Reset the network between classes. RNNs will recognize that you expect a constant output per each sequence, decide which output with the first few images, then just saturate the right neurons using the recurrent connections to generate a constant output regardless of the input. You can verify this by then testing the network on a sequence of elements from a constant class, followed by one (or more) elements from another class: they will likely be misclassified. All intelligent learning picks up on shortcuts whenever available, here is a famous example (check the full paper): [husky vs. wolf](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/A-husky-on-the-left-is-confused-with-a-wolf-because-the-pixels-on-the-right_fig1_329277474).
